cicada 3301


In twenty-nine volumes, knowledge was once contained. How many lines of the code remained when the Mabinogian paused
mabinogion code
-perhaps the book itself is coded
  -welsh language possible
    -possible an english version is differently formated or just wrong, may contain code


Books that once contained knowledge
-books of yore that contain things once thought correct?
  -most likely a specfic version of things cause otherwise confusion
    -Roman? i know that we only have one copy of the works of catulus.
